## Installation

##### Prerequisites:

- Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download and install them from nodejs.org.
- Verify the installation by running the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

```

npm -v
```

Now you have to install typescript in your machine. Here we use typescript for making our code more scalable and organized. For installing typescript on your project, you have to run the following command.

```
npm install -g typescript
```

1. Unzip the template package and in the root project folder Agenify, go to your command line and run `npm install`. This will install the npm packages listed in the package.json file.
2. Run `npm run dev` command.
3. You should now have the project files set up and all the npm packages installed.
