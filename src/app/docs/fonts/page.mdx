## Fonts

We use `Google Inter font` on this template. If you want to use any other google font, then you have to navigate to `src/app/layout.tsx`. And there you will find this line of code.

```
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
const workSans = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });
```

Here you just have to import your own google font.
